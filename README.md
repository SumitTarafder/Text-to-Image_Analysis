# Text-to-Image_Analysis
### This repository contains all the scripts and generated images by all the models for Text to Image generation model comaprison.

#### Stable Diffusion:

The folder 'Stable_Diffusion_Analysis' contains the code for the analysis performed on the Stable Diffusion model. The notebooks are self explanatory for the most part, and if not, we have included descriptions inside the notebooks.

#### Daal-E Mini:

The folder DallE_Mini_Faces_Analysis contains the code for the analysis performed on the Dall-E Mini model. The notebook names are intuitive. We have a descriptive notebook 'Dall-E Mini Inference Pipeline' which downloads and generates images from the model. Besides this, the function of each notebook can be assumed from the name. We have separate notebook files for the image extraction and the fid score calculation.
